# API Capability and Safety Audit

This document is the gate for the API-backed production-suite branch. It keeps
feature selection grounded in the FL Studio scripting APIs and in the project's
contribution rule: project-modifying tools must be reversible.

## Safety Contract

No tool may mutate FL Studio project state unless it can be rolled back through
the MCP safety layer. Read-only actions are the only exception.

Every persistent write must provide:

1. A scoped snapshot before the write.
2. The smallest practical FL command or generated script operation.
3. Readback of the affected state.
4. A persisted changelog entry with restore data.
5. A user-facing before/after result.
6. A rollback path through MCP.

Transient runtime actions, such as play/stop and note preview, do not need
project rollback, but they must still fail safely and must not leave stuck state.

If a capability cannot satisfy this contract, it stays read-only, dry-run-only,
or manual-instruction-only.

## Evidence Levels

Use these labels before implementing a feature:

| Level | Meaning | Allowed implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `documented` | Official Image-Line docs expose the API. | Implement after live smoke test. |
| `documented-unconfirmed` | Official docs expose the API, but a live smoke failed or was state-dependent. | Keep behind targeted probes/manual guidance until a false-positive check verifies target state, focus/selection, indexing, readback timing, and rollback. |
| `live-probed` | Current FL build exposes and executes the API. | Implement with version/capability reporting. |
| `existing` | Current MCP already exposes it safely. | Reuse; do not duplicate. |
| `probe-needed` | Name exists or docs imply a path, but behavior is unverified. | Build a probe first, not a user tool. |
| `api-limited` | No stable API path is known. | Read-only plan or manual instruction only. |

## Current Safety Baseline

Run the local audit before adding write tools:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_tool_safety.py
```

The current branch has no static write gaps or unresolved `needs-review`
tools; this is the PR gate:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_tool_safety.py --fail-on-gaps
```

That command should pass today and fail if a new unsafe or unclassified tool is
added.
For historical context, the pre-fix ratchet was:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_tool_safety.py --max-write-gaps 9
```

For downstream tooling or PR bots, the same audit can emit JSON:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_tool_safety.py --format json
```

The audit statically classifies FastMCP tools as:

- `read-only`: no FL mutation found.
- `transient`: runtime action that should not persist in the project.
- `external-write`: writes outside FL, for example MIDI file export.
- `server-state`: changes MCP/server state only.
- `write-safe-required`: uses `safety.safe_write`,
  `safety.safe_write_group`, or the established Piano Roll safety path.
- `write-gap`: mutates FL without the rollback contract.
- `needs-review`: cannot be confidently classified statically.

`write-safe-required` is the canonical class name for persistent FL writes.
The legacy `write-safe` name is not accepted for new operation-registry specs
or public tool annotations.

The initial gaps on this branch were older direct-write tools:

- Tempo writes in transport.
- Arrangement pattern/marker writes.
- Piano Roll generated-script writes and transforms.
- Composer tools that select a channel and call the Piano Roll bridge.

They now route through the safety layer. Piano Roll writes are backed by FL
Studio undo: the generated scripts wrap edits in `flp.score.undoSection()` when
available, and MCP rollback invokes `general.undoUp()`.

## Dynamic Mixer Track Handling

Status: `documented` for reading the current mixer-track count; `probe-needed`
for creating or inserting new dynamic mixer tracks.

FL Studio 2025 projects may expose far fewer mixer tracks until additional
tracks are created in FL. Tools must treat out-of-range mixer targets as
project/fixture state, not as proof that mixer, plugin, routing, or effect-slot
APIs failed.

Current shipped behavior:

- Mixer, plugin, effect-slot, native EQ, channel-target, and routing write/read
  tools validate requested mixer tracks against the current `mixer_track_count`
  before dispatching controller commands.
- `fl_assign_channel_to_free_mixer_track` only assigns channels to existing
  empty default mixer tracks. If none exist, it returns manual/probe-needed
  guidance instead of pretending it can create one.
- Plugin parameter reads use transient timeout retries, and plugin parameter
  writes use idempotent value readback verification before success is reported.

Not currently supported:

- User-facing creation or insertion of new dynamic mixer tracks. If a current
  FL build exposes a mixer-track create/insert API through `api_probe`, add a
  rollback-safe live probe first: confirm API presence, create the smallest
  possible track, verify count/readback, restore/delete/undo immediately, and
  record the exact FL build and rollback result before promoting the capability.

The current baseline, regenerated on 2026-06-14, reports:

- 94 registered public FastMCP tools with 94 unique public names after v2.0
  legacy low-level alias removal.
- 167 statically audited tool definitions.
- 33 registered `write-safe-required` tools.
- 0 `write-gap` tools.
- 0 `needs-review` tools.
- 41 registered `read-only` tools.
- 4 `server-state` tools.
- 2 `external-write` tools.
- 1 registered `transient` domain tool and 6 statically audited transient
  legacy/helper tools.
- 13 registered tools are not covered by the static AST audit because they are
  registered via direct `mcp.tool()(fn)` calls without safety annotations.
- 86 statically audited legacy low-level tool definitions remain in source for
  helper/test compatibility but are intentionally absent from public
  registration.

`--fail-on-gaps` is the current no-regression gate for `write-gap` and
`needs-review` findings.
`scripts/check_tool_registration_baseline.py` is the registration baseline
check. The previous duplicate `project_doctor_tools.register(mcp)` call was
removed as behavior-preserving registration cleanup.

The `fls-pilot-doctor` CLI was added for v3/alpha first-run diagnostics. It is
not a public MCP tool and does not add FL Studio write capability. Its allowed
runtime actions are read-only setup probes only: Python/dependency inspection,
MCP stdio/SSE session smoke tests, TCP daemon health, MIDI port listing,
heartbeat freshness, controller ping/build-marker readback, and local
`MCP_Apply.pyscript` file detection. It must keep MCP server transports, the
TCP daemon/bridge, and the FL Studio controller script as separate findings so
transport success is not treated as project readiness.

The `fls-pilot-status` CLI was added for v3/alpha as a read-only local
status page export. It is not a public MCP tool and does not add FL Studio
write capability. Its collector is limited to existing bridge/resource status
reads, MCP safety changelog reads, and generated static HTML/CSS/JS output. It
must mark unavailable and API-limited data separately from live bridge data and
must not use project mutation, setup mutation, render/save/open automation, or
playlist clip editing.

The `fls-pilot-control-center` CLI was added for the v3 first-run/run
experience as a localhost-only browser Control Center. It is not a public MCP
tool and does not add FL Studio write capability. Its setup status model reuses
Setup Doctor findings, manual FL Studio setup steps are stored only as
in-memory user-confirmed checkpoints, and setup remains read-only against FL
Studio project state. Its process controls are limited to local child processes
it starts itself, such as the daemon and SSE server; externally running
processes may be detected but must not be killed. Port conflict handling may
select or recommend fallback localhost ports for the Control Center, and
SSE server, and daemon, but it must update displayed snippets/reports whenever
the selected port changes.

The v2.0 internal operation registry skeleton was added on 2026-06-04 without
public MCP registration changes. It describes existing write-safe-required mixer,
channel, and tempo primitives for later validation and batching work; it does
not add new FL Studio API capability claims.

The registry was expanded on 2026-06-04 for transport, mixer, and channel
operations that already have shipped safe wrappers or read-only/transient
protocol commands. It now records read-only specs, transient transport specs
that are excluded from persistent write batching, and rollback-backed write
specs for existing mixer/channel primitives. Step-sequencer write specs require
an explicit pattern so the snapshot scope is known before mutation.

The registry was expanded again on 2026-06-04 for existing pattern, playlist
track, effect-slot, native mixer EQ, and plugin-parameter primitives without
public MCP registration changes. The expansion mirrors shipped safe wrappers:
pattern length remains documented-unconfirmed on affected FL builds, native EQ
values remain normalized/readback-dependent, and plugin parameter writes require
a concrete resolved integer parameter index before registry preparation. Plugin
loading, preset navigation writes, playlist clip edits, and pattern deletion
remain excluded.

Grouped write safety was strengthened on 2026-06-04 without public MCP
registration changes. `safe_write_group` now validates grouped write entries
before mutation, snapshots all write scopes before the first write, builds all
restore actions before mutation, performs per-write readback through supported
snapshot scopes, enforces explicit `verify` readback pairs, and immediately
attempts reverse rollback when a later write fails after earlier writes
executed. Slice 12 review on 2026-06-05 tightened the rollback path so the
current attempted write is included before its bridge call returns, covering FL
commands that mutate before raising. Failed grouped writes still raise an
exception for compatibility with existing callers, but the structured failure
and rollback details are attached to `GroupWriteError.result`.

The additive `fl_transport` domain tool was added on 2026-06-04 for v2.0
domain-tool parity testing. It validates actions through the internal operation
registry, dispatches read-only and transient transport actions directly through
registry-built protocol payloads, and routes persistent transport writes through
`safety.safe_write` with the same rollback/readback behavior as the legacy
transport tools. Legacy transport tools were retained during the shadow phase;
as of 2026-06-05, `fl_transport` also exposes `ping` and the legacy transport
aliases are no longer registered.

The additive `fl_mixer` and `fl_channel` domain tools were added on
2026-06-04 for v2.0 domain-tool parity testing. They validate actions through
the internal operation registry, paginate list reads where needed, and route
persistent writes through `safety.safe_write` with the same rollback/readback
behavior as the legacy mixer and channel tools. Legacy mixer/channel tools were
retained during the shadow phase; as of 2026-06-05, domain-covered legacy
mixer/channel aliases are no longer registered.

The additive `fl_pattern` and `fl_playlist` domain tools were added on
2026-06-04 for v2.0 domain-tool parity testing. They validate actions through
the internal operation registry, paginate list reads where needed, and route
persistent pattern and playlist-track writes through `safety.safe_write` with
the same rollback/readback behavior as the legacy pattern/playlist tools.
`fl_playlist` is limited to playlist track metadata/control; playlist clip
placement, movement, deletion, and editing remain unsupported. Pattern deletion
also remains unsupported. As of 2026-06-05, legacy pattern/playlist aliases
are no longer registered.

The additive `fl_effect` and `fl_plugin` domain tools were added on 2026-06-04
for v2.0 domain-tool parity testing. They validate actions through the internal
operation registry and route persistent effect-slot, native EQ, and
already-loaded plugin-parameter writes through `safety.safe_write` with the
same rollback/readback behavior as the legacy wrappers. `fl_plugin` resolves
string parameter names to concrete integer parameter indices before registry
dispatch. Plugin loading/insertion, plugin removal, preset navigation writes,
and full effect-chain restore remain unsupported. As of 2026-06-05, legacy
effect/EQ aliases and already-loaded plugin-parameter aliases are no longer
registered; read-only plugin preset guidance remains registered.

The additive `fl_piano_roll` domain tool was added on 2026-06-04 for v2.0
domain-tool parity testing. It consolidates existing Piano Roll note writes,
chord writes, clear, quantize, transpose, duplicate, velocity ramp, marker
helpers, and explicit readback-limit reports. Generated-script writes continue
to route through `safety.safe_piano_roll_write`, which records FL Studio undo as
the rollback primitive. Note and marker readback remain API-limited, so Piano
Roll write actions are not eligible for generic persistent `fl_batch` writes.
As of 2026-06-05, legacy Piano Roll one-off aliases are no longer registered.

The initial `fl_batch` tool was added on 2026-06-04 for read-only operation
batches only. It accepts registry operation IDs (`domain`, `action`, `params`)
from a strict read-only whitelist, rejects raw protocol command fields and
generated script/code text, enforces a hard 50-operation limit, and supports
`continue_on_error` for runtime read failures. Persistent writes, transient
runtime controls, external writes, and Piano Roll generated-script actions are
rejected in this slice.

Persistent `fl_batch` writes were added on 2026-06-05 through the verified
grouped-write safety path. A batch must be homogeneous: either all read-only
operations or all persistent-write operation-registry specs. Write batches
reject `continue_on_error`, pre-validate all operation IDs and params before
bridge access, reject raw protocol/script fields, and execute through
`safety.safe_write_group` as one named rollback unit. Mixed read/write,
transient, external-write, excluded, or Piano Roll generated-script batches are
rejected before mutation. Live FL Studio smoke tests were not run for this
slice; focused tests use a fake bridge plus the real grouped-write helper.
Slice 12 review added regression coverage for a persistent batch write that
mutates and then raises; the immediate group rollback restores both the failed
attempt and earlier writes.

The Phase 5 product workflow internal refactor was completed on 2026-06-05
without public tool registration changes. Routing Review route writes and
mixer bus renames now prepare their `safe_write_group` entries through the
operation registry, which adds the registry's existing validation and explicit
route readback verification while preserving the grouped rollback path. Mix
Review `trim_volume` now prepares its mixer volume write through the registry
before calling `safety.safe_write`. Project Organizer channel renames and hex
color write helpers were intentionally left on their existing local builders
because their public input compatibility does not exactly match the current
registry specs.

Phase 6 legacy low-level removal was completed on 2026-06-05. The public
FastMCP surface now keeps consolidated domain tools plus product workflows,
safety/history tools, resources, Knowledgebase tools, plugin preset guidance,
and specialized workflows. Redundant legacy aliases were removed without
deprecation wrappers, and the unsafe direct Internal EQ wrapper registration was
removed in favor of `fl_effect`'s rollback-backed native EQ path.

The agent orientation resource was added on 2026-06-07 as `fl://agent-briefing`.
It is read-only and compact: it reports cheap bridge/status context when
available, lists current domain/workflow entrypoints, and states
Knowledgebase-first, rollback/readback, and stop-rule guidance. It adds no
controller command, no FL write capability, and no public FastMCP tool.

The product workflow Knowledgebase policy pass was completed on 2026-06-06
without adding new FL Studio API capability claims. The read-only `kb_policy`
helper loads only whitelisted JSON policy files and returns source-qualified
rule metadata. Mix Review uses those references to explain findings and
proposals, including the distinction between Master/output clipping and
insert-track headroom risk. Project Health, Routing Review, Project Organizer,
and Chain Planner expose relevant KB policy references in their read-only plans
or safe-write responses. Mix Review's user-facing findings and proposals keep
compact per-row rule IDs, confidence levels, and safety limits, while full
source-qualified rule details stay centralized in top-level `kb_policy_refs`.
KB policy data is not executable operation data: persistent writes still route
through operation-registry validation and `safety.safe_write` or
`safety.safe_write_group`.

The v3 workflow report contract was added on 2026-06-13 without new FL Studio
API capability claims. Mix Review, Project Health/Preflight, and Project
Organizer reports now use `fls-pilot.workflow-report.v1`, separating
`diagnostics`, `proposed_changes`, `applied_changes`, and `manual_checks` while
embedding `json_report` and `markdown_report` renderings. Project Organizer
apply tools and `fl_apply_mix_adjustment` now require `approved=True` before
dispatching persistent writes; approved organizer cleanup writes, including
channel-routing cleanup, still route through operation-registry entries and
`safety.safe_write_group`.

The Low-End/Stereo Safety Assistant was added on 2026-06-07 as a read-only Mix
Review companion. `fl_review_low_end_stereo` uses the existing mixer snapshot
path plus `mixer_list_tracks.stereo_sep` metadata from controller build
`channels-v39` to flag conservative bass/sub mono-compatibility risks, widened
low-end metadata, low-end layering, hot low-end peaks, and Master headroom.
It does not claim true phase correlation, mono-sum cancellation, or spectral
sub-band width, and it does not add stereo-separation, mid-side EQ, plugin
loading, mastering, save, or render writes.

Electro template topology awareness was added on 2026-06-07 without new FL API
claims or write paths. The classifier consumes existing mixer, routing, and
channel readbacks to recognize the live-measured `Electro` stem/M/S setup and
marks premaster, stem bus, sidechain-control, source, and reserved-placeholder
tracks. Product workflows use this metadata to suppress false cleanup,
missing-high-pass, ungrouped-routing, and low-end stereo findings for template
structure while preserving normal diagnostics outside matched templates.

Template profile ingest tooling was added on 2026-06-07 without new FL API
claims or write paths. `scripts/normalize_template_dump.py` reads previously
captured read-only dump JSON and writes compact Knowledgebase profiles under
`knowledgebase/templates/profiles/`; `scripts/validate_template_profiles.py`
validates those profiles against the schema and cross-checks structural
consistency. These scripts do not contact the bridge or mutate FL Studio state.

Data-driven standard template recognition was added on 2026-06-07 without new
FL API claims or write paths. The classifier consumes existing read-only
mixer, routing, and channel-routing data and compact Knowledgebase profiles to
produce runtime role annotations and tool-policy flags. Product workflows use
that metadata to preserve template buses, reserved placeholders, and
sidechain-control routes before making cleanup or mix-review judgements.
Structurally identical profiles are reported as ambiguous candidates rather
than exact template identity.

## API-Backed Feature Packs

### Step Sequencer

Useful API:

- `channels.getGridBit`
- `channels.setGridBit`
- `channels.getStepParam`
- `channels.getCurrentStepParam`
- `channels.setStepParameterByIndex`
- Step parameter constants such as `pVelocity`, `pPan`, `pShift`, `pRepeat`.

MVP:

- Read a channel step grid.
- Set/clear steps.
- Write a full pattern.
- Shift a pattern.
- Randomize velocity with dry-run preview.

Safety requirement:

- Snapshot all changed grid bits and step parameters before writing.
- Apply a full-pattern write as one grouped rollback unit.

### Channel Organizer

Status: `documented`, `live-probed`.

Useful API:

- `channels.getChannelName` / `setChannelName`
- `channels.getChannelColor` / `setChannelColor`
- `channels.getChannelType`
- `channels.getTargetFxTrack` / `setTargetFxTrack`
- `channels.getChannelVolume` / `setChannelVolume`

MVP:

- Rename/color channels.
- Classify channel types, including audio clip/generator/automation.
- Assign unrouted channels to mixer tracks.
- Apply confirmed audio defaults such as channel volume 50%.

Current shipped slice:

- `fl_channel(action="get")`
- `fl_detect_unassigned_channels`
- `fl_channel(action="set_name")`
- `fl_channel(action="set_mixer_target")`
- `fl_assign_channel_to_free_mixer_track`

Safety requirement:

- Add snapshot scopes for channel name, color, target mixer track, and volume.
- Keep Stretch Pro/Normalize out of the MVP until a real API path is proven.

### Pattern Management

Status: `documented`, `live-probed`; `setPatternLength` is
`documented-unconfirmed` on FL Studio Producer Edition v25.2.5 build 5055 until
the targeted false-positive probe verifies whether the documented v39 API is
absent, stale-controller related, target-state dependent, or readback delayed.

Useful API:

- `patterns.patternNumber`
- `patterns.patternCount`
- `patterns.getPatternName` / `setPatternName`
- `patterns.getPatternColor` / `setPatternColor`
- `patterns.getPatternLength` / `setPatternLength`
- `patterns.clonePattern`
- `patterns.movePattern`
- `patterns.jumpToPattern`
- `patterns.findFirstNextEmptyPat`

MVP:

- Detailed pattern list/current/select.
- Rename/color/length.
- Clone/move.

Safety requirement:

- Clone and move need explicit restore behavior.
- Do not implement delete/merge/split until an API-backed rollback story exists.

Current next slice:

- Pattern color and length writes with scoped snapshots. ✅ shipped
- Current pattern selection snapshot/restore for grouped organizer changes.
- Find-empty-pattern as read-only planning support. ✅ shipped
- Clone/move only after live smoke verifies stable readback and restore.

Live evidence and false-positive probes:

- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: `patterns.setPatternLength` is
  documented, but `api_probe dir` did not expose `setPatternLength` on FL
  Studio Producer Edition v25.2.5 build 5055, and the rollback-safe write
  command returned API unavailable before mutation. Keep the tool
  `documented-unconfirmed` on this build; do not remove support solely from
  this runtime result.

### Playlist Track Organizer

Status: `documented`, `live-probed` for track-level operations.

Useful API:

- `playlist.trackCount`
- `playlist.getTrackName` / `setTrackName`
- `playlist.getTrackColor` / `setTrackColor`
- `playlist.muteTrack`
- `playlist.soloTrack`
- `playlist.selectTrack`

MVP:

- List playlist tracks.
- Rename/color/mute/solo/select playlist tracks.

Safety requirement:

- Snapshot track name/color/mute/solo state.
- Treat select as transient or restore previous selection.

Not currently supported:

- General playlist clip enumeration.
- Stacked/overlapping clip detection.
- Clip movement/deletion.

### Effect Slot Control and Native Mixer EQ

Status: `documented`, partially `live-probed`. Track-slot enable has passed
live smoke. Slot mix and per-slot mute are `documented-unconfirmed` on FL Studio
Producer Edition v25.2.5 build 5055 until the targeted false-positive probe
checks API presence, occupied-slot targeting, selected-track variants, readback
timing, and rollback. Native EQ writes remain `live-probed` where readback
sticks on the tested build/state.

Useful API:

- `mixer.getPluginMixLevel`
- `mixer.setPluginMixLevel`
- `mixer.isTrackSlotsEnabled`
- `mixer.enableTrackSlots`
- `mixer.isTrackPluginValid`
- Live-probed: `getPluginMuteState`, `setPluginMuteState`.
- `mixer.getEqGain` / `setEqGain`
- `mixer.getEqFrequency` / `setEqFrequency`
- `mixer.getEqBandwidth` / `setEqBandwidth`
- `mixer.getEqBandCount`

MVP:

- List effect slots with plugin names and slot mix.
- Set slot mix.
- Bypass/enable all slots on a track.
- Read native mixer EQ.
- Apply simple low/high shaping intents as fallback when no EQ plugin is loaded.
- Per-slot bypass and EQ type changes only after live readback is proven.

Safety requirement:

- Snapshot slot mix and bypass state.
- Snapshot every changed band parameter before writing.
- Do not promise full chain restore; plugin loading/removal is API-limited.

Current next slice:

- Expose a user-facing Effect Slot + Native EQ Pack over the already-probed
  primitives. ✅ shipped
- Add static audit coverage for slot and EQ restore payloads.
- Live-smoke slot mix, track-slot enable, EQ gain/frequency/bandwidth, and
  rollback before promoting per-slot bypass or EQ type changes.

Live evidence and false-positive probes:

- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: `mixer.setPluginMixLevel` did not
  stick on track 49 slot 0 (`Fruity Limiter`) or track 50 slot 0 (`Fruity
  parametric EQ 2`), although rollback restore remained safe. Because the API
  is officially documented, this remains `documented-unconfirmed`, not final
  `api-limited`, until `scripts/probe_documented_api_live.py` checks direct and
  selected-track variants.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: the false-positive probe verified
  `mixer.setPluginMixLevel` on Master track 0, slot 8 (`Fruity parametric EQ
  2`) in both direct and selected-track variants, with rollback verified. Slot
  mix is therefore target/plugin/state dependent, not globally `api-limited`.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: per-slot mute/enable returned API
  unavailable on the same targets. This stays probe-gated because the exposed
  `plugins.getPluginMuteState` / `setPluginMuteState` path is live-probed but
  not part of the documented mixer slot API surface.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: native EQ setter names were present,
  but gain writes did not stick on tracks 0, 1, 49, or 50 while rollback/restore
  remained safe. Keep Native EQ writes `documented-unconfirmed` until a narrower
  target/state probe proves a working path.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: targeted Native EQ high-pass attempt
  on mixer track 8 `Drums` partially stuck: band 0 frequency moved to the
  normalized 120 Hz value (`0.2594`), but type stayed `0` instead of the
  attempted high-pass value `3`. User visual inspection found no visible mixer
  EQ change on track 8. Rollback by change ID restored the original band state.
  Native EQ type writes need a dedicated REC event/value mapping probe before
  user-facing high-pass configuration can be promised.
- 2026-06-01, offline: added constrained Native EQ type mapping probe support
  (`mixer_probe_eq_type`, controller build marker `channels-v38`, and
  `scripts/probe_native_eq_type_live.py`). The probe tries documented
  REC_Mixer_EQ_Type value/flag variants with immediate rollback and is not
  exposed as a user-facing MCP tool.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v38`: Native EQ type mapping probe found no
  working high-pass type write on mixer track 8 `Drums`, band 0. Raw integer,
  update-only, MIDI-scaled, and candidate type values all read back as
  `type=0`; float values were rejected by `processRECEvent` because the value
  must be an integer. Do not expose Native EQ high-pass/type configuration as a
  user-facing tool on this build.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: generic plugin parameter writes did
  not stick for any of Fruity Limiter's 18 exposed parameters on track 49 slot
  0; keep Limiter sidechain configuration manual until a stable parameter path
  is proven. Do not generalize this result to all plugin parameters; EQ2 passed
  below.
- 2026-06-01, controller `channels-v37`: Fruity Parametric EQ 2 plugin
  parameter write/readback/rollback passed on track 50 slot 0, Band 4 level.

### Step Parameter Pack

Status: `documented`, `probe-needed` for value ranges and restore behavior per
parameter.

Useful API:

- `channels.getStepParam`
- `channels.getCurrentStepParam`
- `channels.setStepParameterByIndex`
- Step parameter constants such as `pVelocity`, `pPan`, `pShift`, and
  `pRepeat`.

MVP:

- Read step velocity, pan, pitch/shift, release, and modulation where available.
- Set one step parameter at a time with readback. ✅ shipped
- Apply full-pattern humanization as one named rollback unit after individual
  parameter writes are live-smoked.

Safety requirement:

- Snapshot the affected channel's grid and every changed step parameter.
- Start with read-only inspection for parameters whose ranges vary by FL build.
- Do not ship randomized bulk writes until deterministic readback and rollback
  are verified.

### Project Health and Organizer

Status: orchestration over API-backed primitives.

MVP:

- Project health report with read-only findings. ✅ shipped
- Export readiness report with blocker/advisory split. ✅ shipped
- Dry-run fix plan that references existing rollback-safe tools. ✅ shipped
- Fix execution remains one approved write at a time.
- Grouped rollback for organizer actions.

Safety requirement:

- No direct writes. The doctor must call only safe lower-level operations.
- Multi-step organizer changes must be one named rollback unit by default.

### Piano Roll Return Channel and Comfort Transforms

Status: `documented` for local Piano Roll note/marker mutation,
`api-limited` for returning note data to the MCP server.

Useful API:

- `flp.score` note access and mutation inside a generated Piano Roll script.
- Note properties such as time, length, number, velocity, pan, release, color,
  slide, porta, selected, and muted where exposed by FL's Piano Roll API.
- Marker creation and mutation where supported by the active FL build.

Allowed next steps:

- Build a return-channel probe before promoting
  `fl_piano_roll(action="get_notes")`. ✅ shipped
- Add undo-backed transforms for duplicate, humanize, velocity ramp, gate,
  legato, overlap trim, strum, arpeggiate, mute/unmute, note color, slide,
  porta, and snap-to-scale.
- Add marker helpers only as generated, reviewable script payloads.

Current shipped slice:

- `duplicate` and `velocity_ramp` transforms are shipped as undo-backed writes.
- Initial marker helpers are shipped as generated-script writes:
  add marker, add time-signature marker, clear markers.
- `fl_piano_roll(action, params)` is shipped as the consolidated domain tool
  for existing undo-backed writes and readback-limit reports. Legacy Piano Roll
  one-off aliases are no longer registered.
- Piano Roll writes can optionally retarget a channel/pattern through the
  controller before the generated script is triggered. The controller uses
  `ui.openEventEditor` with `channels.getRecEventId(...)` when available and
  falls back to `ui.showWindow`.
- Marker and note readback remain API-limited; rollback uses FL undo.

Safety requirement:

- Treat every generated script transform as a write tool.
- Use the existing Piano Roll undo-backed safety path.
- Return explicit readback limitations until the return-channel probe is
  solved.
- Avoid destructive delete-selected/delete-region until selected note data can
  be captured and restored.

### Edison / Audio Editor Script Tool

Status: `documented`, `probe-needed` for MCP return paths and practical rollback.

Useful API:

- Audio Editor scripts can operate on Edison and Slicex audio through generated
  scripts.
- Documented operations include sample/selection edits such as normalize,
  amplification, silence, reverse, trim, centering, and region operations.

Allowed next steps:

- Generate and install manual audio editor script templates.
- Build read-only probes for sample length, selection, sample rate, channels,
  region count, and region names if a reliable return path exists.
- Prefer offline audio artifact generation: analyzed WAV copies, markerized
  WAV files, region JSON, CUE-style metadata, and reviewable reports.

Safety requirement:

- Do not directly mutate the active Edison/Slicex sample without an audio
  snapshot and restore path.
- Treat generated audio editor scripts as manual/probe workflows until restore
  data is complete.

### Slicex

Status: `documented`, `probe-needed`.

Useful API:

- Slicex can consume slices and region metadata from audio material.
- Official docs describe both Audio Editor script usage and Slicex editor
  scripting surfaces, so FL-version behavior must be probed before committing
  to a single implementation path.

Allowed next steps:

- Build a Slicex prep pack outside FL: transient detection, zero-crossing
  alignment, markerized WAV export, and region metadata export.
- Generate manual Slicex script templates for region cleanup and reporting
  after the active scripting path is verified.
- Keep Slicex-to-Piano-Roll workflows manual or artifact-based until readback
  and rollback are proven.

Safety requirement:

- Do not auto-load Slicex, load samples, dump score, send clips to the
  playlist, or delete regions through UI automation.
- Direct region/sample edits need full restore data before becoming tools.

## Probe-Needed or Limited Areas

| Area | Current result | Allowed next step |
|---|---|---|
| Audio clip Normalize | Manual documents the UI setting; no direct MIDI scripting setter confirmed. | Probe REC/event paths only. |
| Stretch Pro mode | Sampler UI documents mode; MIDI scripting exposes stretch time, not clearly the mode. | Research/probe, not MVP. |
| Source sample path | No direct channel file-path getter confirmed. | User-supplied paths or later probe. |
| Piano Roll note readback to MCP | Piano Roll scripts can read notes locally, but the bridge has no return channel. Existing `get_notes`/domain readback actions report this API limit instead of returning notes. | Generated transforms only; keep readback as explicit API-limited reporting until a return channel is proven. |
| Playlist clip overlap detection | No general clip enumeration API confirmed. | Keep track-level only. |
| Plugin loading | API controls loaded plugins; loading instances remains unsupported. | Suggest/load-manually/configure-loaded model. |
| Plugin preset next/previous | FL exposes preset navigation, but no verified MCP restore primitive. | Read-only/manual guidance only. |
| Edison/Slicex destructive live edits | Audio editor scripts can mutate samples, but no MCP-level audio snapshot/restore path exists. | Manual script generation, probes, or offline artifacts only. |
| Slicex scripting path | Official docs expose Slicex scripting surfaces, but practical Python vs legacy editor behavior must be verified per FL build. | Build a probe before user-facing tools. |
| Full FLP snapshot/restore | MCP can snapshot affected state, not the full project file. | MCP-local snapshots only. |

## Contract-Broken Capabilities

These capabilities must not be exposed as user-facing write tools until a
future design proves the full safety contract:

- Plugin loading or plugin insertion.
- Playlist clip editing, placement, movement, or deletion.
- Pattern or clip deletion.
- Project open, project new, project render, or similar file/session commands.
- Raw UI automation or raw escape-hatch calls.
- Destructive Edison or Slicex live edits without an audio snapshot.
- Preset next/previous as a write action without verified readback and
  rollback.

## Feature Gate Template

Before coding a new tool, fill this out in the PR description or design note:

```text
User value:
API evidence:
Safety class:
Snapshot scope:
Restore operation:
Readback:
Rollback unit:
Dry-run behavior:
Tests:
Live FL build verified:
```

If any of `Snapshot scope`, `Restore operation`, or `Readback` is unclear, the
tool is not ready to write FL state.
